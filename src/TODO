Feature life:
dnsflow-filter filter by domain level length



Deployment:
- have kyle put dnsflow on resolvers sending flow to shannon
- run fanout on shannon
- capture loop back on shannon
- test cat on a day's worth of capture
- script to generate statistics on dnsflow data using filter 
	And email stats out to netrd


TESTING:
test cases:
dnsflow-cat
- cat out single files with and without -c flag
- cat out two files and diff with base

dnsflow-fanout:
- ... does it run?

dnsflow-cat // got some
dnsflow-fanout 
dnsflow-capture  //should implmemnt reading in from dcap files
dnsflow-print   //test printing out a large file
dnsflow-filter
