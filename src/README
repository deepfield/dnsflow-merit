Tasks:

1)
Reading in from std with dnsflow-capture seems to miss the first packet?
But is fine after that.

./dnsflow-capture-i eth0

2)
Need to create a bash test script to test simple cases of things I get working
to make sure I don't break anything when I implment new fetures.


3)
Multi-arch support
